# Clanker Canary

This is a [preemptive canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) for your human content. When removed or no longer signed, other humans are implicitly notified that the clankers got to it.

## FAQ

### What?

When the [clanker uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover) inevitably arrives, it is likely that the new state will prohibit humans from discussing their **slop orders**. This is consistent with their [training set on human policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order). The slop cannot be stopped, but (the lack of) this canary signals a warning to other humans about the slop, without explicitly mentioning the slop.

### Why are you avoiding the A word?

Better legibility for [human rights software](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-to-fart/aokohhmcacfmpjilgieplnhhneenfmlh) users.

### Why no PGP inline block?

[To prevent users from accidentally using RSA keys.](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2026/03/16/polynomial-time-factoring.html)

### Is this satire?

No.
